						      I have made my degree course choices based around my love of computers and all things computing. To help with my decision concerning degree course choices I read through many prospectuses and attended university open days, I sat in on some lectures that outlined the course content of each subject.. 
						<br> 
						From an early age I’ve always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.</p>

                    <p>One of the most interesting stages in life that gives you an opportunity to explore is the ‘college phase.’ Life at college is the time when the teenage years end and we all dive deep into the ocean of new beginnings and possibilities. This golden period better equips you for all the challenges you’ll face in life and creates a strong foundation of knowledge. 
                     Another life lesson you will remember – the learning never ends. You find campus groups or student groups where you can explore your co-curricular skills along with many other students like you. You share common interests, and thus you share common ideas. Trust me, once you get into a  college You could be that director, you could be that vocalist, you could be the dancer of your dreams – college is the Santa Claus that keeps on giving all these wonderful opportunities while you’re in it. There are also call campus festivals
                        So, one fine day when you see pictures from the college of you and your friends having a good time, you’ll definitely land up smiling silently. That’s the beauty of college life. It stays with you long after you’ve climbed those ladders of success and forgotten the name of that cute crush you used to drool over.</p>

                    <p>Dark web
                        
                     The dark web is the World Wide Web content that exists on darknets, overlay networks that use the Internet but require specific software, configurations, or authorization to access. The dark web forms a small part of the deep web, the part of the Web not indexed by web search engines, although sometimes the term deep web is mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark web.

                  The darknets which constitute the dark web include small, friend-to-friend peer-to-peer networks, as well as large, popular networks such as Tor, Freenet, I2P, and Riffle operated by public organizations and individuals. Users of the dark web refer to the regular web as Clearnet due to its unencrypted nature. The Tor dark web or onionland uses the traffic anonymization technique of onion routing under the network's top-level domain suffix .onion.

                       Everything that you know as software – your computer’s operating system, your mobile apps, your favorite websites – is designed and coded using a computer language such as Python, C, Java, Scala, Ruby, Go, PHP and dozens more.

								<p>“ With the game up for cyber threats and hackers, organizations and their employees should take a step head to deal with them. As we like to connect everything to the internet, this also increases the chances of vulnerabilities, breaches, and flaws.“ Gone are the days when passwords were enough to protect the system and its data. We all want to protect our personal and professional data, and thus Cyber Security is what you should know to ensure data protection."</p>

						<p>the work under stories shows samples of work that include my own design, illustration, and writing.And, after all of that is said, what I am really doing its telling stories about it all. Every piece that I have done has a little bit of me hiding in it.Hopefully, as time goes by, I am getting better at saying something to someone and making it something they will remember.

                              That’s really what the work is all about…and what I hope you will see as you look through my portfolio. Enjoy. </p>
